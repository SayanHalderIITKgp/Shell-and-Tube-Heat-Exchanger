# Shell-and-Tube-Heat-Exchanger
Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger using Python


Created the entire design of a Shell and Tube heat exchanger using Numpy , Pandas and other libraries of python where Wall thickness , InnerDiameter ,Temperature and other physical properties , LMTD correction factor including unit change ,Area Calculation of the tubes , Mass flow rate , Reynold's Number , Heat transfer coefficient , velocity calculation , error measurement on area of the tubes as well as heat transfer coefficient etc all things are computed using python .
